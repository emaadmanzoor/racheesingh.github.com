As a part of [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) 2012 I am working on a project with [CERN SFT](http://sftweb.cern.ch) as the mentoring organization. The project is titled "Continuous cartography of public network services".
In this project I will be working on an algorithm that maps IP addresses of CERN [Virtual Machine File System]() clients to mirror servers in such a way that network latency is reduced. I would also be building a web application to allow administrators to dynamically add/remove mirror servers. The application should allow for visualization of mirror locations across the globe on a Google/OpenStreet map.

[Here](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/racheesingh/9002) is the project proposal I submitted for Google Summer of Code 2012.

	
Carlos Aguado SÃ¡nchez is my mentor. On this blog, I will document day-today developments of the work.
